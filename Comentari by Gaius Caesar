Gaul, as it is being called now, is divided into three parts. 
One is inhabited by the celts, who are relatively peaceful. 
Another is inhabited by belgians, who are more warlike than the celts, but are not blood thirsty. 
The third part is entirely tribal, being inhabted by the disgusting race of people known as germans. 
They drink blood and also piss. They should be put in zoos.
